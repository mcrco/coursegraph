Quantities that arise en route to these solutions include entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information for discrete and continuous random variables. The course explores the calculation of fundamental communication limits like entropy rate, capacity, and rate-distortion functions under a variety of source and communication channel models (e.g., memoryless, Markov, ergodic, and Gaussian). The course begins with a foundational discussion of the simplest communication scenarios and then expands to include topics like universal source coding, the role of side information in source coding and communications, and the generalization of earlier results to network systems. Network information theory topics include multiuser data compression and communication over multiple access channels, broadcast channels, and multiterminal networks. Philosophical and practical implications of the theory are also explored. This course, when combined with EE 112, EE/Ma/CS/IDS 127, EE/CS 161, and EE/CS/IDS 167, should prepare the student for research in information theory, coding theory, wireless communications, and/or data compression.\n Part b not offered 2024-25",

The core idea behind this theory is to rearrange the mass of a reference measure to match a target measure. In particular, optimal transport seeks a rearrangement that transports mass with minimal cost. The theory of optimal transport dates back to Monge in 1781, with significant advancements by Kantorovich in 1942 and later in the '90s, e.g. by Brenier. In recent years, measure transport has become an indispensable tool for representing probability distributions and for defining measures of similarity between distributions. These methods enjoy applications in image retrieval, signal and image representation, inverse problems, cancer detection, texture and color modelling, shape and image registration, and machine learning, to name a few.
